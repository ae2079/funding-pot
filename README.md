# Funding Pot

## Quickstart

1. Get an ankr api key [here](<[here](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/advanced-api/)>)
2. Fund two accounts with testnet ETH on Base Sepolia
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.test` and fill in the api key as well as the two private keys
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run test:e2e`
6. Check the following files for the results:

- inputs:
  - batchConfig (to be set per batch): `data/test/input/batches/3.json`
  - projects (to be set once): `data/test/input/projects.json` (=> `GENERATED_TEST_PROJECT`)
  - allowlist (to be once; can be edited over time): `data/test/input/allowlist.json`
- outputs:
  - batchReport: `data/test/output/GENERATED_TEST_PROJECT/3.json`

## Terminology

Within the project the term `batch` refers to one instance of running a funding interval. That includes

- users contributing within a given time interval (= transferring collateral tokens to the safe)
- using these funds to buy from the bonding curve
- calculating the amounts of issuance tokens that contributors receive
- creating linear vestings for contributors

Note: this script does not cover the claiming of tokens by contributors

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/InverterNetwork/funding-pot.git && cd funding-pot && npm install`

Next you will have to set some environment variables.

## Run the tests

### Prerequisites

- you have an ANKR API key for their "advanced API" (get one [here](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/advanced-api/))
- you have two private keys whose addresses are funded with small amounts of testnet ETH on Base Sepolia

### Instructions

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.test` and fill in the values. In order to run all tests, you need to have an **ANKR API key** and specify **two private keys**. One key is associated with the **single owner of a Safe** and the other the key is associated with the role of a **delegate** who can **propose transactions** to that safe. You will require a small amount of _testnet ETH_ on Base Sepolia for both accounts. When running the e2e tests, the private keys will be used to setup an safe and workflow for your personal accounts that is used to test against.

### Unit tests

`npm run test:unit`

### End-to-end test

The `main.e2e.test.js` file is an end-to-end test that tests the whole flow from safe creation to vesting creation. Specifically it does the following steps:

- deploy a safe (via Safe's Protocol and API Kits)
- add the delegate to the safe (via the [Safe Transaction API](https://docs.safe.global/core-api/transaction-service-overview))
- deploy the workflow (via the [Inverter SDK](https://github.com/InverterNetwork/sdk))
- make all inverter-related workflow configurations
- send some contributions to the safe from the owner and delegate accounts (using [this](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xC4d4598AE5843ed851D81F4E35E97cCCC4E25D80) collateral token)
- generate & save a project & batch config as well as an allowlist
- execute the funding pot script
- sign and execute the transactions from the safe (via Safe's Protocol and API Kits)

By running this test, you will be able to understand the input parameters that the script requires, as well as the output that it produces.

To just the end-to-end test use the following command:

`npm run test:e2e`

**NOTE:** Due to the number of transactions and API calls involved with this test, it regularly fails for wallet-related reasons (nonce issues). If this happens, you can try to run the test again.

### Cleanup

Since the end-to-end test uses some randomness for determining the contribution sizes, it can happen that both test contributors hit the 2% cap and don't qualify for joining the funding pot. In this case you can clean up the test data by running `npm run clean` and start from scratch.

This command will remove all auto-generated files from `/data` and allows you to generate new ones the next time you run the tests.

## Run the script

### Prerequisites

- you have an ANKR API key
- you have added the address associated with your delegate private key as delegate to the safe (you can also do this via [this](https://gnosis-safe-delegate-dapp-nine.vercel.app/) UI)
- you have deployed and configured the workflow
- you have deployed the NFT contract used for the early access round

### Instructions

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. If the delegate has already been added to the Safe that you want to propose to, setting the `DELEGATE` private key is enough.

- add at least the delegate key (`DELEGATE`) to your `.env`
- add the ANKR API (`ANKR_API_KEY`) key to your `.env`
- make sure that `CHAIN_ID` and `ANKR_NETWORK_ID` are set to the correct values

### Configuration options / Inputs

There are three types of inputs that the script executor can take. They can all be found under `/data/production/input`.

1. `projects.json`: Contains on object where each key is a project name and each value is an object containing the safe address and the orchestrator address of the project. This file should be updated whenever a new project is added or an existing one is updated. There is an example file under `/data/test/input/projects.json`. If you run the tests for the first time, an additional project ("GENERATED_TEST_PROJECT") will be added to `/data/test/input/projects.json`.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "SOME_PROJECT": {
    "SAFE": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "ORCHESTRATOR": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    "NFT": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
  },
  "ANOTHER_PROJECT": {
    "SAFE": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003",
    "ORCHESTRATOR": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000004",
    "NFT": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000005"
  }
}
```

2. `allowlist.json`: Contains an array of addresses that are allowed to contribute to a given round. This file should be updated whenever a new address is added or an existing one is removed. If you run the e2e test for the first time, an example file is generated in `/data/test/input/allowlist.json`.

**Example:**

```json
[
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000006",
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000007"
]
```

3. `batches/<batchNr>.json`: For each batch, a JSON file needs to be added to the `batches` directory. The file contains the vesting timelines (start, cliff, end) for that batch, the timeframe (fromTimestamp, toTimestamp) expressed in unix time during which contributions will be considered, the limits that apply to the contributions, as well as a flag if it's an early access round or not. If you run the e2e test for the first time, an example file for a fictional 3rd batch is generated in `/data/test/input/batches/3.json`.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "VESTING_DETAILS": {
    "START": "1726861746", // vesting start in unix time
    "CLIFF": "60", // seconds until cliff from start
    "END": "1726861806" // vesting end in unix time
  },
  "TIMEFRAME": {
    "FROM_TIMESTAMP": "1726861686", // start timestamp
    "TO_TIMESTAMP": "1726861818" // end timestamp => between these timestamps users can contribute
  },
  "LIMITS": {
    "INDIVIDUAL": "500", // individual contribution limit in collateral token (decimals are added automatically)
    "TOTAL": "1500" // total limit applying to the batch in collateral token (decimals are added automatically)
  },
  "IS_EARLY_ACCESS": false // if its an early access round or not (=> if NFT check is applied in addition to allowlist check)
}
```

### Running the script

#### For a single project

To run the script for one project use the following command:

`npm run project <PROJECT_NAME> <BATCH_NUMBER>`

- `PROJECT_NAME`: the name of the project you want to run the script for; used to fetch project-specific configurations from `projects.json`
- `BATCH_NUMBER`: the batch number you want to run the script for; used to fetch batch-specific configurations from `batches/<BATCH_NUMBER>.json`

**Example:**

The following command will run the script for the 3rd batch of the project `FUNKY_FOXES`:

`npm run project "FUNKY_FOXES" 3`

### Checking the script's output

When the script has executed a JSON report will be added under `data/production/output/<PROJECT_NAME>/<BATCH_NUMBER>.json`. You can use this file to better understand what has been proposed to the safe.

#### For all projects

To run the script for all projects use the following command:

`npm run all <BATCH_NUMBER>`

- `BATCH_NUMBER`: the batch number you want to run the script for; used to fetch batch-specific configurations from `batches/<BATCH_NUMBER>.json`

**Example:**

The following command will run the script for the 3rd batch for all projects defined in the `projects.json`:

`npm run all 3`

## Technical Specification

In summary this project does three things:

1. Contributions: it records transfers of the funding token to a safe that occur within a given timeframe (= contributions)
2. Calculations: filters these transfers by eligibility (specified by allowlist & NFT holdings) and calculates the amount of reward tokens that will be vested to each contributor in return for contribution
3. Execution: assembles and proposes (via a Safe delegate flow) multisend transactions to the safe to use contributions for buying reward tokens from the bonding curve and stream them to contributors

### Details on the calculation logic

- contributions per user per batch are capped
- how much a user can contribute is calculated as follows:
  1. the batch config (`/input/batches/<batchNr>.json`) specifies the amount of collateral tokens that a user can contribute per batch
  2. the batch config also specifies a total cap on the batch and if this cap is reached the batch is closed
  3. the unfilled total cap carries over to the next batch (the individual cap doesn't)

## Implementation details

### Assumptions

- all rewards paid out to contributors remain fully vested over the lifetime of this script

### Structure

#### Data

- subdivided into `production` and `test`
- `input`: contains the user input data for the scripts
- `output`: per batch and project, a JSON report will be generated in this folder

#### Services

The services are where the most of the logic sits. All services are classes that store most of the outputs of their respective operations in state. This is then later used to generate the report.

- `Batch`: contains the logic for calculating who gets how many tokens
- `Queries`: contains the logic for querying external data sources
- `Safe`: contains the logic for interacting with the safe
- `TransactionBuilder`: contains the logic for generating transaction batches

#### Steps

The steps tie the services together and bring an order into the execution flow.

1. `loadInputs`: loads input parameters provided by the user as JSON files as well as environment variables
2. `validateInputs`: validates the input parameters and environment variables
3. `instantiateServices`: instantiates the services using the input parameters and environment variables
4. `defineBatch`: defines the batch by calculating the contributions, eligibility, received allocations, vesting details etc.
5. `proposeBatch`: bundles all transactions into batched multisend transactions that are then proposed to the safe via the delegation mechanism (tx batch size is defined in `config.js`)
6. `storeReport`: services "log" their logic operations; this data is used to generate a `report` json file that describes the batch
